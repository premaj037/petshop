            <h1>PET GUIDELINES</h1>
            <h3>Animal lovers know too well the challenges of keeping a dog/pet in a housing society.<br> To ensure that community living is not hampered in any way, there are certain pet rules in a housing society that residents must follow.<br>To start off, the Animal Welfare Board of India has passed certain dog laws to ensure our furry companions are not harassed or treated unfairly. Both pet owners and the management must be aware of laws for pet owners living in apartments. These dog laws and awareness about pet rights help to keep the housing society functions smoothly.
               This article takes an in-depth look at the pet rules in housing society in India.</h3>

            <h3>The cat  is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</h3>

            <h3>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.<br> Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.</h3>

              <ul class="para"><li><h4>Pets</h4></li><p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
